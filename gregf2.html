    <p>I would like to work in digital strategy for a biotechnology company. In college,
      I studied biochemistry and a minor in entrepreneurship.
      I started working in cell culture cancer research lab. Once I graduated,
       I moved to Colorado to work for Bio-Techne, a biological research reagent company.
      For the first year there I worked with their supply network. This involved yearly
      margin negotations and data integrity management of the supplier's product line.</p>
