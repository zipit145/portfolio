                    <p class="summary col-md-12">Gregâ€™s career started out culturing cells for cancer research while studying biochemistry at Purdue University.
                         After completing his degree, Greg began working for Novus Biologicals (Bio-Techne) handling supplier relationships.
                          This position was a mix of data management and supplier negotiations/ communications.
                           This lead to him self-teaching VBA to generate ~100,000 material safety data sheets for Japanese sodium azide regulations.
                         The success of this project got him a job offer on the corporate web development team.

                            Greg worked as a developer at Bio-Techne for the last three years. A desire to further challenge himself lead him to leave the comfort of his career path.
                            His education in biological research had come from many different educators and been further reinforced with real world applications.
                             His programming experience however was entirely self-taught and applied on one team at the same organization. This is what led him to the Galvanize Web Development Immersive program.
                              Greg chose this course to shore up his foundational skillset in programming and to start towards his goal of mastery of development and management of front end data visualization applications.
